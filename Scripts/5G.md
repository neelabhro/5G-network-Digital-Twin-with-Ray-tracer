. ./venv/bin/activate  
python makeECM.py  
ip a  
sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyUSB2  
sudo chmod +x quectel-CM  
sudo ./quectel-CM

The Above may sometimes lead to issues with ttyUSB2 in use. The following may be attempted:

Kill the modemmana process. 
Attempt to run: 
python makeECM.py 
python off.py
python on.py 

If this does not work:
1. replug the dongle
2. run: sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyUSB2
3. attempt to run:
   python makeECM.py
   python off.py
   python on.py

Connection has consistently been able to be established and kept if the three commands above run successfully.  

sudo lsof /dev/ttyUSB2
sudo kill -9 pid
